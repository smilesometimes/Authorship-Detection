<h2>Authorship Detection</h2>

<p>
    Automated authorship detection is the process of using a computer program
    to analyze a large collection of texts, one of which has an unknown author,
    and making guesses about the author of that unattributed text.
    The basic idea is to use different statistics from the text 
    -- called "features" in the 
    machine learning community -- to form a linguistic "signature" for each 
    text. One example of a simple feature is the number of words per sentence. Some
    authors may prefer short sentences while others tend to write sentences that go 
    on and on with lots and lots of words and are not very concise, just like this one. 
    Once we have calculated the signatures of two different texts we can 
    determine their similarity and calculate a likelihood that they were written 
    by the same person. 
</p>
<p>
    Automated authorship detection has uses in plagiarism detection, 
    email-filtering, social-science research, and as forensic evidence in court cases.
    Also called authorship attribution, this is a current research field and the
    state-of-the-art linguistic features are considerably more complicated than
    the five simple features that we will use for our program. But even with our
    very basic features and simplifications, your program may still be able to make
    some reasonable predictions about authorship.
</p>

<h2>Starter Code: <code>author_functions.py</code>, <code>author_program.py</code></h2>
<p>
	We have begun a program that guesses the author of a text file
    by comparing its signature to a given set of linguistic signatures.
    Download the starter code <a href="../starter/author_functions.py">author_functions.py</a> and <a href="../starter/author_program.py">author_program.py</a>.
    (Be sure to right-click on the links in your browser so that you can use
    "<code>Save Link as...</code>" rather than copying and pasting the code.)
    Once the files are set-up according to the steps below, <code>author_program.py</code> runs, but does almost nothing, because many of the functions'
    bodies are incomplete.  Your task is to finish the incomplete functions in both files,
    as well as to add and use appropriate helper functions.   	
</p>


<h2>An Overview: How the program works</h2>

<p>
	The program begins by asking the user for two strings: 
	the first is the name of a file of text whose authorship is unknown
    (the mystery file) and the second is the name
    of a directory where each file in that directory contains the linguistic signature for one file of text. Note that a <b>directory</b> and <b>folder</b> are two words for the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	The program calculates the linguistic signature for the mystery file and then 
    calculates scores indicating how well the mystery file matches each signature file in the 
    directory.  The author from the signature file that best matches the mystery
    file is reported as the most likely author of the text in the mystery file.
</p>

<h2>Definitions: What is a token, word, sentence, and phrase?</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this assignment, here are a few definitions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you call the <code>str</code> method <code>split</code> on a line from a file, you get a list of strings back. Each string in that list is a called a <strong><em>token</em></strong>.

    <p>
    Here is <code>help(str.split)</code>:
</p>
    <pre>S.split([sep]) -> list of str

        Return a list of the tokens in S, using string sep as the 
        separator. If sep is not specified, any whitespace string
        is a separator and empty strings are removed from the result.
    </pre>
     
    </li>
    <li>A <strong><em>word</em></strong> is a non-empty token  from the file that isn't completely
       made up of punctuation.
       <ul>
        <li>You'll find the words in a file by using 
           <code>split</code>
           to get the tokens and then removing the punctuation from the beginning and end of the tokens using the helper function 
           <code>clean_up</code> that we provided in <code>author_functions.py</code>.
           If calling <code>clean_up</code> results in an empty string,
           then that empty string isn't considered a word.
           Notice that <code>clean_up</code> also converts the string to lowercase. 
           This means that the cleaned up versions of <code>'yes'</code>, <code>'Yes'</code> and <code>'YES!'</code> will all be the same word.  Words may contain inner punctuation; for example, <code>"it's"</code> is a word with a length of 4 and <code>'hard-and-fast'</code> is a word with a length of 13.</li>
       </ul>
   </li>
   <li>A <strong><em>sentence</em></strong> is a string that:
       <ul>
        <li>is followed by (but doesn't include) the terminator characters <code><bf>! ? . </bf></code> or the end of the file,
        </li>
        <li>excludes whitespace on either end, and</li>
        <li>is not empty.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Consider <a href="sentence_example.txt">this file</a>.
        Remember that a file is just a linear sequence of characters,
        even though it may look two dimensional.
        This file contains these characters:
        <pre>
            this is the\nfirst sentence. Isn't\nit? Yes ! !! This \n\nlast bit :) is also a sentence, but \nwithout a terminator other than the end of the file\n
        </pre>
        By our definition, there are four sentences in the file:
    </p>

    <!--table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" -->

    <p>
        <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"
        <tr>
            <td> Sentence 1</td>
            <td><pre>"this is the\nfirst sentence"</pre></td>
        </tr><tr>
        <td> Sentence 2</td>
        <td><pre>"Isn't\nit"</pre></td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td> Sentence 3</td>
    <td><pre>"Yes"</pre></td>
</tr><tr>
<td> Sentence 4</td>
<td><pre>"This \n\nlast bit :) is also a sentence, but \nwithout a terminator other than the end of the file"</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
   Notice that:
   <ul>
       <li> The sentences do not include their terminator character.
           <li> The last sentence was not terminated by a character;
            it finishes with the end of the file.
            <li> Sentences can span multiple lines of the file.
            </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>A <strong><em>phrase</em></strong> is a non-empty section of a sentence that is separated by colons, commas, or
       semi-colons. The previous sentence (the one before this one) has three phrases by our definition. This sentence (the one you are reading right now) has only one.  This is because we don't separate phrases based on parentheses.
   </p>
</ul>

<p>We realize that these are not the usual definitions for sentences, words, or phrases, but using them here will
   make the assignment easier. More importantly, it will make your results match what we are expecting when we test your code. You may not modify these definitions, because if you do, <strong>your assignment will be marked as incorrect.</strong>
</p>


<h2>Completing <code>author_functions.py</code></h2>

<p>
    In <code>author_functions.py</code>, you must implement five required functions to calculate various linguistic features and a required function to compare authors based on these linguistic features.  In addition, you must add some helper functions (one required, plus others that you choose to add) to aid with the implementation of these functions.  In addition to the descriptions below, please see the docstring descriptions provided in the starter code.  Add a second example function call to each of the given docstring descriptions in <code>author_functions.py</code>.
</p>

        </td>
        <td style="width:80%">
            <p>The first linguistic feature is simply the <b>average number of characters per word</b>, calculated after the punctuation has been stripped using the already-written <code>clean_up</code> function. In the sentence prior to this one, the
                average word length is 6.04.  Notice that the comma and the final period are stripped but the hyphen inside "already-written" and the underscore in "clean_up" are both    counted. 
                        
                    </p>

                <td style="width:80%">
                    <p>The second linguistic feature, the <b>Type-Token Ratio</b>, is the number of different words used in a text divided by the total number of words in that text. (This feature is a measure of the repetitiveness of the vocabulary.) Again you must use the provided <code>clean_up</code> function so that "this","This","this," and "(this" are considered the same and are <em>not</em> counted as different words.
                    </p> 
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td style="width:80%">
                    <p>
                        The third linguistic feature, the <b>Hapax Legomena Ratio</b>, is similar to Type-Token Ratio in that it is a ratio that uses the total number of words as the denominator. The numerator for the Hapax Legomena Ratio is the number of words that occur exactly once in the text.  In your code for this function you must not use a Python dictionary (even if you have already learned about them on your own or are reading ahead in class) or any other technique that keeps a count of the frequency of each word in the text.  Instead, use this approach: As you read the file, keep two lists. The first 
                        contains all the words that have appeared at least once in the text and the second has all the words that have appeared at least twice in the text. Of course, the words on the second list must also appear on the first. Once you've read
                        the whole text, you can use the two lists to calculate the number of words that appeared <em>exactly</em> once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note: you will be marked not only on correctness, but also on whether you follow the approach specified above.

                   <p>
                    This is a helper function.  Several features require the program to split a string
                    on any of a set of different separators, and this function will be used to do that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Test this function carefully on its own before trying to use it in your other 
     functions.

                    <p>
                        The fourth linguistic feature your code will calculate is the <b>average
                        number of words per sentence</b>.

                        Tip: Sentences can span multiple lines. Rather than work with the given <code>list of str</code> (list of lines), start by creating a single huge string containing all of the strings, in order, from the list of lines. Next, call function <code>split_on_separators</code> on that huge string.

                        the average number of phrases per sentence. We will 
                        find the phrases by taking each
                        sentence, as defined above, and splitting it on any of colon, semi-colon, or comma.

         <h3>Signature Files</h3>
            <p>
        We have created a 
        <a href="data.shtml">set of signature files for you to use</a>
        that have a fixed format. The first line of each file is the name of the
        author and the next five lines each contain a single float number. These are values
        for the five linguistic features in the following order:
        <ul>
            <li>Average Word Length</li> 
            <li>Type-Token Ratio</li> 
            <li>Hapax Legomena Ratio</li> 
            <li>Average Sentence Length</li> 
            <li>Average Sentence Complexity</li> 
        </ul>
        You are welcome to create additional signature files for testing your code and for
        fun, but you must not change this format. Our testing of your program will depend
        on its ability to read the required signature-file format.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Determining the best match</h3>
    <p>
        To determine the best match between an unattributed text and the known signatures, 
        the program uses the function 
        <code>compare_signatures</code>, which calculates and returns a measure of 
        the similarity of two linguistic signatures. You could imagine developing some
        complicated schemes, but our program will do almost the simplest thing
        imaginable. The similarity of signatures <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> 
        will be calculated as the sum of the absolute
        differences on each feature, but with each difference multiplied by a "weight" so
        that the influence of each feature on the total score can be controlled. In other words,
        the similarity of signatures a and b (<code>S<sub>ab</sub></code>) is the sum over all 
        five features of: the absolute value
        of the feature difference times the corresponding weight for that feature.
        The 
        equation below expresses this definition mathematically:
        <br></br>
        <img src="equation.jpg"> 
        <br></br>
        where <code>f<sub>i,x</sub></code> is the value of feature <code>i</code> in signature
        <code>x</code> and <code>w<sub>i</sub></code> is the weight associated with feature
        <code>i</code>.

        <p>
            The example below illustrates this calculation.  Each row concerns one of the five features.
            Suppose signature 1 and signature 2 are as shown in columns 2 and 3, and 
            the features are weighted as shown in column 4.
            The final column shows the contribution of each feature to the overall sum,
            which is 16.5.
            16.5 represents the similarity of signatures 1 and 2.

        Notice that if signatures 1 and 2 were exactly the same on every feature, 
        the similarity would add up to zero.  (It may have made sense to call this "difference" rather
        than similarity.)
        Notice also that if they are different on a feature that is weighted higher,
        their overall similarity value goes up more than if they are different on a feature
        with a low weight.  This is how weights can be used to tune the importance
        of different features.

<h2>Completing <code>author_program.py</code></h2>

<p>
   In <code>author_program.py</code>, you must implement two required functions.  For functions that involve reading from files or user input (e.g., the two functions described below), do not include example calls in the docstring descriptions.
</p>

<table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Required functions to add to author_program.py.">

        <td style="width:80%">
            <p>
                See docstring description in <code>author_program.py</code>. Do not use <code>for</code> loops, or this function will receive a mark of zero. Use a <code>while</code> loop.
            </p>
            <p> 
                To determine whether a file exists, use the function <code>os.path.exists</code>.
                Function <code>os.path.exists</code> takes a string argument representing the name
                of a file and returns a Boolean to indicate whether the file exists.
            </p>
            <p>
                The help for <code>os.path.exists</code> mentions passing it a path 
                (which is a description of the file and where it exists 
                among all your directories), but if you give it a string that is simply a file name, it will check in the directory in which your code is running.

        <td style="width:80%">
            <p>See docstring description in <code>author_program.py</code>. Do not use <code>for</code> loops, or this function will receive a mark of zero. Use a <code>while</code> loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Use the function <code>os.path.isdir</code> to check whether a string is a valid
     directory.
            </p>

    <h2>Additional requirements</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Do not change any of the existing code.  Read the comments and add your code in the places specified by the comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not round any floating point numbers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not use type <code>dict</code>.
    </li>
 <li>
     Do not add any user input or output, except where you are explicitly told to.
     In those cases, we have provided the 
     exact <code>print</code> or <code>input</code>
     call to use.  Do not modify these.
 </li>
 <li>
    In particular, in <code>author_functions.py</code>, never call <code>print</code> or <code>input</code>. Doing so will cause all tests to fail.
 </li>
 <li>
     Functions <code>get_valid_filename</code> and <code>get_valid_directory_name</code>
     must not use any <code>for</code> loops, or they will receive a mark of zero.
     The purpose of this is to have you practice <code>while</code> loops.
 </li>
 <li>
     You must not use any <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> statements.
     Any functions that do will receive a mark of zero.
     We are imposing this restriction 
     because these statements are very easy to "abuse," resulting in terrible code.
 </li>
</ul>


<h2>How to tackle this assignment</h2>
<p>
	This program is much larger than what you wrote for Assignment 1, so you'll
	need a good strategy for how to tackle it.  Here is our suggestion.
</p>

<h3>Principles:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
     To avoid getting overwhelmed, deal with one function at a time.  
     Start with functions that don't call any other functions; this will allow
     you to test them right away.  The steps listed below give you a
     reasonable order in which to write the functions.</li>

     <li>For each function that you write, start by adding at least one example
        call to the docstring <em>before</em> you write the function.
    </li>
	
<li>
Keep in mind throughout that any function you have might be a useful helper
for another function.
Part of your marks will be for taking advantage of opportunities to call an existing
function.
<li>
	As you write each function, begin by designing it in English, using only a few
	sentences.  If your design is longer than that, shorten it by describing the
	steps at a higher level that leaves out some of the details.
	When you translate your design into Python, look for steps that are described at such
	a high level that they don't translate directly into Python.
	Design a helper function for each of these, and put a call to the helpers into
	your code.
	Don't forget to write a great docstring for each helper!
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>

Here is a good order in which to solve the pieces of this assignment.
<ol>
	<li>
     Read this handout thoroughly and carefully, making sure you understand everything 
     in it, particularly the different linguistic features.
 </li>
 <li>
     Read the starter code to get an overview of what you will be writing.
     It is not necessary at this point to understand every detail of the functions
     we have provided. <!-- in order to make progress on this assignment. -->
 </li>
 <!--
 <li> 
     Create a module called <code>function_tester.py</code> and have it import
     your <code>author_functions</code> module.  
     Add a main block to <code>function_tester</code>: that is where you can
     put your code that tests your individual functions.  For now, it can just
     say <code>pass</code>.
 </li>
-->
 <li>
     Complete <code>author_functions.py</code>: add example(s) to the docstring, implement, and test the functions in this order:
        <ul>        
            <li>
                <code>avg_word_length</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>type_token_ratio</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>hapax_legomena_ratio</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>split_on_separators</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>avg_sentence_length</code>.
         Begin by writing code to obtain a list of sentences from the text. Test that this part of
         your code works correctly before you worry about calculating the average sentence length.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>avg_sentence_complexity</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>compare_signatures</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
 Now you have implemented all the functions in <code>author_functions.py</code>.  Run our <code>a2_self_test.py</code> program (see <a href="index.shtml#testing">Testing your code</a>) to confirm that your code passes our most basic tests.
 
 Correct any errors that this uncovers.
 
</li>
  <li>
    Complete <code>author_program.py</code>: implement and test these functions (note: do not add examples to the docstring, since these two functions involve user input):
        <ul>
            <li>
              <code>get_valid_filename</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>get_valid_directory_name</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
 </li>

<li>
 You are now ready to run the full author detection program:
 run <code>author_program.py</code>. To do this you will need to set up a
 directory that contains <strong>only</strong> valid linguistic 
 signature files. We are providing a set of these on the 
 <a href="data.shtml">data files page</a>. You'll also want some mystery text files
 to analyze. We have put a number of these on the
 <a href="data.shtml">data files page</a>.
 If you are copying them to your home machine, don't put them in the 
 same directory as the linguistic signature files. 
</li>
</ol>	

<h2><a name="testing" id="testing"></a>Testing your code</h2>

<p>
    We are providing a program called 
    <a href="../starter/a2_self_test.py">
        a2_self_test.py</a>
        that imports your <code>author_functions.py</code> and checks that 
        the required functions in that file satisfy some of the basic 
        requirements.
        (It does not check <code>get_valid_filename</code> and
        <code>get_valid_directory_name</code> in <code>author_program.py</code>.)
    </p>

    <p>
        When you run <code>a2_self_test.py</code>, it should produce no errors and its output
        should consist only of one thing: the word "okay".  
        If there is any other output at all,
        or if any input is required from the user,
        then your code is not following the assignment specifications correctly
        and
        <font color="red"><strong>will be marked as incorrect</strong></font>.
        Go back and fix the error(s).
    </p>

    <p> 
        While you are playing with your program,
        you may want to use the signature files and 
        mystery text files we have provided.
        This in conjunction with 
        <code>a2_self_test.py</code> is still <strong>not</strong> sufficient testing to 
        thoroughly test all of your functions under all possible
        conditions.
        With the functions on this assignment, there are many more possible cases
        to test (and cases where your code could go wrong).
        If you want to get a great mark on the correctness of your functions,
        do a great job of testing them under all possible conditions.
        Then we won't be able to find any errors that you haven't already fixed!        
    </p>

    <h2>Marking</h2>

    <p>
            The correctness of your code will count for approximately 80 percent of this assignment. The remainder of the mark will be earned through a code review meeting where the correctness, style, and design of your and other students' code will be examined for the purposes of improvement. A mark of 0 will be given on the entire assignment if you do not attend the code review meeting.
            </p>

            <p>
      Though we are marking for correctness only, we strongly suggest the following advice. Good design, helper functions, and style can go a long way toward helping you get your program right. Plus, it will be good practice for the code review and for Assignment 3!</p>
  
  <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Correctness:</b> Your code
          should perform as specified.
          Correctness, as measured by our tests, will count for the
          largest single portion of your marks.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
          <b>Docstrings:</b> For each function that you design from scratch, 
          write a good
          <code>docstring</code>.
          Do not change the docstrings that we have already written for you, except to add another example or two.
          Make sure that you read the <a
          href="rules.shtml">Python style guidelines</a> page for some important
          rules and guidelines about docstrings.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>
          <b>Internal comments:</b> Within
          functions, the more complicated parts of your code should also be
          described using internal comments.
          For this assignment, internal comments will be more important
          than on Assignment 1.
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Programming style:</b> Your variable names should be meaningful and
      your code as simple and clear as possible.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <b>Good use of helper functions:</b> If you find yourself repeating a task, you should add
  a helper function and call that function instead of duplicating the
  code.
  And if a function body is more than about 20 lines long, introduce
  helper functions to do some of the work -- even if they will only be called once.
</li>
<li>
    <p>
      <b>Formatting style:</b> Make sure that you read the <a
      href="rules.shtml">Python style guidelines</a> page for some important
      rules and guidelines about formatting your code.
  </p>
</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="submitting">Submitting your assignment</a></h2>
<p>
   You must hand in your work electronically, using the MarkUs online system.
   Instructions for doing so are posted on the Assignments page
   of the course website.
   <p>

<p>
    <font style="color:red"><strong>The very last thing you do before submitting should be to run <code>a2_self_test.py</code> one last time.</strong></font> Otherwise, you could make a small error in your final changes before submitting that causes your code to receive zero for correctness.
</p>
    
    <p>
      For this assignment, hand in two files:
      <ul>
          <li><code>author_functions.py</code></li>
          <li><code>author_program.py</code></li>
      </ul>
  </p>

  
<p>
   Once you have submitted, be sure to check that you have submitted 
   the correct version; new or missing files will not be accepted after 
   the due date.
   Remember that spelling of filenames, including case, counts.  
   <font color="red"><strong>If your files are not named exactly as above, 
      your code will receive zero for correctness.</strong></font>
  </p>

  <h2>Future Work</h2>
  <p>
    If you carefully examine the mystery files and correctly code up your assignment, you'll 
    see that it correctly classifies many of the documents -- but not all. Some of the linguistic features 
    that we have used (type-token ratio and hapax legomena ratio in particular) are standard techniques, 
    but they may not be sufficient to do the classification task. There are other standard features
    and more sophisticated techniques that were too complicated for this assignment. Suppose
    you could use a Python dictionary to keep a count of how many times each word appeared 
    in a document. What new linguistic features would that allow you to use? 
    Some authors like to use lots of exclamation marks!!! or perhaps
    just a lot of punctuation?!
    Could you devise a linguistic feature to measure this? While this is fun to think about,
    do <b>not</b> add any different linguistic features to the version of the program that you
    submit for marking.
</p>
<p>Another area for thought is how authorship attribution is related to plagiarism
    detection. In this <a href="http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1930971,00.html?artId=1930971?contType=article?chn=arts">
    TIME magazine article</a>, plagiarism detection software is used to support the claim
    that Shakespeare was the author of an unattributed play.
</p>
<p>
    In the field of machine learning (of which authorship detection is a subfield), programs
    often learn their own configuration values through training.
    In our case, could the program learn from trying to guess an author and
    then being told the right answer? Could it learn to adjust the weights
    being applied to the different features?  What about learning a new feature? How would
    you do this? 
</p>
    <h2>Anticipated FAQs</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><p><b>How do I run <code>author_program.py</code>? Where do I save the files?</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>To begin, save the mystery files in the same directory as your <code>author_functions.py</code> and <code>author_program.py</code> files.</li>
                <li>In that directory, create another directory for the signature files (e.g., call it <code>signature_files</code>). Save the <code>.stats</code> files in that new <code>signature_files</code> directory.  Don't put anything else in that directory.</li>
                <li>Next, run <code>author_program.py</code>.</li>
                <li>When prompted to enter a filename, enter one of the mystery filenames (e.g., <code>mystery1.txt</code>).</li>
                <li>When prompted to enter a directory, enter the name of the directory that contains the signature files (e.g., <code>signature_files</code>).</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Can I define my own helper functions?</b><br><br>
            
            Yes. You are strongly encouraged to do this.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>My code takes a long time to run.  Is that okay?</b><br>
            <p>That depends. It is important to determine whether your code is working properly or whether there is some sort of problem with it. It is okay for your program to take a couple of minutes on the large mystery files. We'll be doing our automated testing with smaller data sets.</p>
            <p> 

            <p>However, your code may have a problem such as an infinite loop, or it may be very inefficient. If that is the case, use the debugger to try to identify which function is taking a long time to execute.</p>

            <p>Consider also whether the problem could have been solved in a simpler way.  For example, if the program reads the text 20 times to reach a conclusion and it could reach the same conclusion by just reading the text once, the approach that reads once would be preferable. If the text is small, you might not be able to tell the difference, but the longer the text gets, then the more pronounced the difference will be.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Will a correctly coded program successfully detect the authors for all mystery files?</b><br>

            <p>Assuming your code is correct, it will be able to correctly detect the authors for all the provided mystery files <em>except one</em>.  Of course, do not just rely on this to ensure the correctness of your code. Make sure you run detailed tests for every function you write.</p>
        </li>
